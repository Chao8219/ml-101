3 Documentation by Sphinx
=========================

Since we want documentation to be neat and beautiful, we can use sphinx 
to generate the html. The `conda's documentation page 
<https://conda.io/docs/index.html>`_ is a good example. It uses 
**sphinx_rtd_theme**. You can find more themed examples in sphinx website: 
`theme example <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/examples.html>`_.

3.1 Install Sphinx
==================

1. I suggest using conda to install the package in conda environment 
   since we are using them.

2. Activate conda

3. Activate conda environment

4. Use command in terminal as follow: 
::

    conda install sphinx

or alternativly, 
::

    pip install sphinx

would do the job.

Note: The rich documentation is still under construction. Find more 
solution from `quickstart <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/
usage/quickstart.html>`_.
